                                        CODE EXPLANATION
                                            by Abeeek
The code is a simple console-based program that simulates a menu ordering system. It displays a list of food and drink options and allows the user to input a menu item number to add it to their order. The program uses an array of structures to store the menu data and a switch statement to handle the user's input. After selecting an item, the user can choose to continue ordering or exit the program. The program also keeps track of the total price of the order and displays it when the user finishes their order.

The getitem() function is used to get the user's input for the menu item and adds it to the order list. The displaysum() function is used to display the total price of the order. The remove() function is not implemented and may have been intended to allow the user to remove an item from their order.

There are a few issues with the code:

The count variable is never incremented, so the displaysum() function always displays a total price of 0.
The itemname array is declared as a string array, but the name variable in the displaysum() function is declared as a char. This will cause a type mismatch error when trying to access the itemname array.
The remove() function is not implemented and may cause confusion for the user if they are presented with an option to remove an item that cannot be removed.
The use of goto statements is generally discouraged as it can make the code harder to read and maintain. In this case, a loop or a function call could be used instead.
The datamenu array is declared as an array of structures, but it is not clear why this is necessary as the menu and harga members could be declared directly in the getitem() function.
