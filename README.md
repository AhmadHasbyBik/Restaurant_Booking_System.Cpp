This is a menu based program for a food ordering system, written in type C++. The program uses a class called "items" to manage a list of items, their prices, and the quantity ordered by the user. The program displays a menu of food and drink items and allows the user to select the items they wish to order. After each selection, the program prompts the user to continue ordering or to finish their order.

The program keeps track of the items ordered by the user, their prices, and the total cost of the order. The user can choose to remove an item from their order, display the list of items ordered, or display the total cost of the order.

The program uses a simple struct to store the menu items and their prices, and it uses a switch statement to handle user input. The program uses a "goto" statement to loop back to the menu after each item is ordered.

Overall, this program provides a simple and user-friendly way for customers to order food and drinks, and it demonstrates basic concepts of object-oriented programming in type C++. However, the use of "goto" statements is generally discouraged as they can make code difficult to understand and maintain.
